# Project Brief

## Scenario

A library wants to improve their current quality analysis, as manually completing the task takes too much time and is less reliable. They are looking for a more efficient way to filter data using Python and automation. They have heard of a tool called Azure DevOps and want to apply it to their process.

## Task

Using the knowledge learnt over the past few modules, design and create a project that uses and manipulates data and puts it into another location ready for presentation purposes. Your project will include:

- Documenting architecture design, testing plans and agile kanban for planning.
- Setting up an agile Kanban board to use for planning.
- Storing code result in a central GitHub Repository.
- Using data provided to manipulate and clean up the results ready for the next stage using Python tools.
- Testing the application with unit testing.
- Using a CI/CD pipeline to automate the data transformation process.
- Reporting security practices that can be applied to the project.

At the end of the project, you will present your findings and end results of the project. Your presentation may include:

- The architecture design.
- A demonstration of the pipeline and application working.
- A talk through the PowerBi infographics.
